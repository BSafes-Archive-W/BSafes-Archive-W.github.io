## CONCLUSION
Unlearning their racist beliefs and leaving the white power movement was very difficult for Angela King, Samantha, and Katie McHugh. Personal relationships and a sense of purpose bound them tightly to their organizations and their ideologies. Afterwards, King had to create a new life for herself after prison, and the work done by McHugh and Samantha for the far-right basically made them unemployable anywhere else. The processes of radicalization and deradicalization have profoundly impacted their lives and their work both inside and outside of these movements have greatly affected the lives of others. The pain inflicted by organized racism easily leads us to blame the actions of King, McHugh, and Samantha on their own moral failings. There is, however, a deeper and more sinister structure at work; one that takes advantage of women who feel ostracized and foists a sense of purpose upon them. It is because of this structure that these women feel compelled to share their stories and to fight for redemption – not only for themselves – but for others who have left the movement as well. Their experiences illustrate the great potential of not just former female white power members, but of women in general in deradicalizing extremists.
