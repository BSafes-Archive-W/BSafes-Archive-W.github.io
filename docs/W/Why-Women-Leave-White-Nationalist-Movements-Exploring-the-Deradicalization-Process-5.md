## LIMITATIONS
This is a very limited exploratory research essay. The selection of these narratives is biased towards women who freely joined white supremacist groups and were able to leave and safely share their stories. This study does not consider the fact that the differing reasons for leaving hate groups could have an impact on the successful deradicalization process of an individual. Additionally, it can be assumed that there are a number of women who tried and failed to leave white power groups or succeeded but due to safety concerns cannot share their stories. The interpretations in this essay of the significance of gender in the deradicalization are tentative because there is simply insufficient data to draw any certain understanding. Any definite conclusions regarding the extraction process of women from organized racism warrant further research.
