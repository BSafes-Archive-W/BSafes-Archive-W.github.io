## Abstract
There is a strong relationship between media and the belief systems we hold. The film industry, for example, has great influence on ideals, perceptions, and expectations of human life. While the effects of film content are widespread, it is especially important to examine the specific implications film has on our ideas about relationships. Romance, as a prevalent aspect of our lives, is commonly depicted in films across genres. Consistent to most film content, there is great debate about how accurately these depictions translate to real life. Even with great efforts made by producers to create plotlines that are realistic, various factors compete to create the content we consume. To be successful, producers and screenwriters have to create stories that sell—adding embellishments that keep audiences engaged and spark emotional responses. This work will look at how the depiction of romance in film affects and influences beliefs and perceptions of audience members.

The purpose of this research is to identify how romance in film contributes to relationship abuse. Several psychological concepts will be used to consider an explanation. These include cultivation theory, homophily, social learning theory, desensitization, and script theory. I hypothesize that both relational and physical abuse are in part derived directly from the media we consume, specifically what is seen in film. Since beliefs are created over time and impacted by a myriad of environmental/other factors, it is challenging to prove a causal relationship between film content and abuse. However, this research will analyze relevant literature to examine the strength of the connection. Using existing research, I will present an argument for how relational abuse is connected to romantic film content. This literature review is a needed and relevant addition to the existing research for several reasons. While there is ample research that seeks to explore the effects film and television content on viewers, many works are limited to analyzing within the confines of specific genres. The present study differs in that it considers the broader perspective of romance in film across all genres. Romance plots or subplots in film often involve unrealistic portrayals of relationships. This includes endorsement of flawed romantic ideals, lack of realistic conflict shown, and unhealthy behaviors (such as abuse) rewarded. Unrealistic depictions of romance in film affects viewers by shaping beliefs and expectations about healthy relationships. In turn, this leads to behavior that reflects these beliefs and expectations.

With established psychological concepts, I will thoroughly explain how media influences beliefs and behavior. Abuse will then be defined and analyzed in its many forms. This section will look at the literature that has explored personality and situational domains as well as various patterns found within the study of abuse. Next, research surrounding romantic ideals and romantic media content will be considered. Several studies have created a foundation of content analysis in film, which will aid in determining common themes that are most prevalent in the top-grossing movies. Finally, the concepts will be applied more specifically to romance in film to establish the effects on viewers.
