## Abstract 
This essay aims to explore primarily why women leave white nationalist movements, and the possible role of gender in the  radicalization and deradicalization of white women in white nationalist movements. This essay examines the narratives of three  former white supremacist women - Angela King, Samantha, and Katie McHugh - and identifies patterns in their journeys. This study  has a limited scope due to the small number of case studies available and needs further research. In attempting to connect different  narratives of former white supremacist women in an under-studied area, I take the liberty to interpret their stories within the broader  framework of organized racism. For clarity’s sake, organized racism and hate, extremism, the alt-right, white power, nationalism,  and supremacy are used interchangeably.
