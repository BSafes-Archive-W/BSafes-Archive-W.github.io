## Artificial Intelligence from The South
Automated decisions differentially affect the most vulnerable groups, if this is not made visible and expressly fought from the objectives of the implementation of these technologies, it leads to reinforcing processes of social control and precariousness that have been at the base of the construction of many of our societies, both to ensure the dominance of the most privileged social and economic classes, and to facilitate the exploitation of the most vulnerable.

Although the international human rights framework is not enough to face social justice issues, it is still a tool capable of controlling technological implementations that serve human development with agency and dignity, to the extent that the collective dimensions of human rights -and not only the individual ones- are highlighted, as well as the value of economic, social, cultural and environmental rights as part of a unique and interconnected system of equal value rights for the development of a democracy with social justice in our region.

The promise of technology is the improvement of our lives, and it can be of tremendous value to our region. Unlocking that value for inclusion and social justice depends on putting those objectives as central in the road map and not using limited substitutes such as the ethical treatment of data. Technological developments and deployments should not result in new forms of discrimination, which with efficiency or effectiveness as a flag deepen other inequalities as collateral damage that we must assume in favor of a supposed greater good represented by progress.

A diverse democratic debate on the implementation of technologies and a practical approach to fundamental rights from the creation of impact assessment systems in the design, implementation, and monitoring of AI projects is the most concrete way to put these technologies at the service of reducing the inequality and inclusion gaps that still prevail in our region.
